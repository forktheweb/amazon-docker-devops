# amazon-docker-devops
my way to do devops on amazon aws using docker

> this is an ongoing project that is essentially a guidebook on how I do devops related tasks, in supplement to the dockistry project.  Dockistry is in pre-alpha, but these command guides are what I use to design the go-lang code used in dockistry automated events.

## [chapter 1](https://github.com/forktheweb/amazon-docker-devops/blob/master/setup-ubuntu.md)
- setup an ubuntu trusty instance
- install gems support
- install nodeJs
- install the aws-cli, and aws-shell, and saws
- install and mount elastic fs using NFS4

## [chapter 2](https://github.com/forktheweb/amazon-docker-devops/blob/master/setup-nginx-rancher-boom-etcd-go-ssl.md)
- link your cross-cluster credentials and cluster-management commands
- a backup process for keyrings
- command and key/value management
- setting up websites on SSL
- setting up rancher management
